Compilation of the latest 2100 median warming projections from UNEP, CAT, IEA and CR (as of 9 November 2021), compared to the assessed warming values for the five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios highlighted in the [IPCC AR6 WG1](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/) report. Both central estimates and uncertainty ranges are shown. Note that the IEA current policy scenario (STEPS) is in-between policies in place today and 2030 commitments.
