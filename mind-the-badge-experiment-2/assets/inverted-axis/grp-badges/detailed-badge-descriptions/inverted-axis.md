# Inverted Axis

This badge warns that the **vertical axis has been flipped**.

In this chart, lower crime values are plotted **higher up** on the axis, and higher values are plotted **lower down**. As a result, a **real decrease in crime** (from 100 down to 50) produces a line that **slants upward**, which can easily be misread as an increase.

When you see this badge:

- Pay close attention to the **axis labels and their order** (0 at the top, higher values at the bottom).
- Remember that an **upward line does not always mean an increase** when the axis is inverted.
