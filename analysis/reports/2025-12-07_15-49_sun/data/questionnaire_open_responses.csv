badge,5dcfaad2dd9a740c2493fc28,uniform,,"Not really, I noticed them but didn't actively use them or feel they were relevant to what I was looking for.",I just read what they were and tried to understand the data.,"No, I didn't think they were that relevant.","I didn't use any of them, I didn't think there were relevant as some of them said things like ""no data"" when there was.",No because I didn't use them to their full potential.,,Yes
badge,67eee89119de070d8b864f60,tango,"The presence of interactive or detailed elements, like hover descriptions on badges, significantly deepens engagement by transforming a static chart into a self-documenting tool. This layered approach—simple labels for quick scanning and rich details on demand—catered to both a high-level understanding and a readiness to drill into methodological nuance, which is essential for trusted analysis.","Yes, I noticed them immediately.  I was unable to read the lines as conclusive facts since they served as a pre-brief, setting expectations that the data was predictive, uncertain, and synthesized from different models.","The titles alone, such Contains Predictions, were completely clear for quick context.  The hover explanations for Uncertainty Shown and Multiple Data Sources offered crucial, non-optional detail for a thorough knowledge of how the uncertainty was assessed and modeled.","Absolutely. The speech explicitly uses terms like ""median,"" ""range,"" and ""high-end risk,"" which are direct reflections of the ""Uncertainty Shown"" and ""Multiple Data Sources"" badges, ensuring the summary accurately conveyed the data's conditional nature.","The most useful was ""Uncertainty Shown,"" as it defined the visual structure of the chart itself. The least immediately useful for the verbal summary was ""Actual Time Offset,"" though it is important for a full technical audit of the data.","Yes, they were fundamental. They efficiently communicated the provenance and limitations of the data, allowing me to quickly build a correct and nuanced narrative about future scenarios and policy gaps, rather than spending time deciphering the chart's methodology.",none,Yes
footnote,63956692bbbcfadf1156c3a2,sierra,,,They were quite easy to understand though I did not know what the acronyms all were.,Yes I used the footnotes to understandd the graph.,,Yes especially the second one as I did not initially understand it,None,Yes
footnote,5827634ea80bf4000199994b,romeo,,,"It was fairly, except that the climate change one could have included more information, such as what are IPCC scenarious. I looked that up on Google so I could better explain the graph.","Now that I think of it, no, I don't remember using footnotes in the first one. I read the footnotes in the second one but drew my conclusions and wrote the description based on the info in the graph.",,"No, not really, I used the graphs for my information. ",none,Yes
badge,6697cf02d714e7ee3fdedcec,quebec,I had not noticed that they were interactive- they'd not given the indication that they were. ,"They did not help me especially, as all I got from them was info such as that multiple sources were taken into account in the data. ","Easy to understand, but maybe not as helpful as it might have been without hovering over. ","I don't think I did, no. ","I didn't find any of them super helpful, maybe because I was unaware of the hovering function. ",Not really; they seemed like footnotes rather than anything that was integral to understanding the information. ,N/A,Yes
footnote,67f015260f679212b3c34caa,papa,,,Some parts were understandable but some felt  a bit vague and not easily uderstandable to a typical person,"Yes, I considered the general ides behind them. I mainly considered the data source and the definition of the chart. ",,"Yes, they helped to a certain extent by helping me indetify where the data came from hence able to come up with a credible speech.",I agree they should be widely used alongside visualizations but they should make it easy for a normal person to undertand the information represented                        ,Yes
badge,55eb4774748092000baa97ee,kilo,I hovered my mouse over some of the badges to receive more information.,Yes they helped me to learn more about what I seeing and to be able to better interpret it.,Very easily! I just wish some of the abbreviations were explained in the descriptions.,"I took it into consideration but it wasn't a big part of my speech, I mainly detailed the data and figures.",The graph felt easier to read and understand to me.,Yes they explained some of the information that I had questions about.,"I liked having them, it made me trust the information more!",Yes
badge,65537e14439274fe5036b4d2,oscar,"I noticed that i could use them, but mainly stuck to the information on the graph","They provided a little information about sources, but nothing that really stuck out as useful.",They seemed ok.  The hover feature was most useful as the label alone didnt provide any meaningful help.,"They provided a little more detail for what I was writing, but overall used the graphs.",I liked the ones that gave information as to what the labels meant.   Some seemed overly complicated.,"Not really, I did not use them that much.  I felt they provided some info., but the visuals really catch your eye and attention.",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,5d879c06e645c60019847113,november,"I noticed this towards the end, and found it very helpful.","Yes, they helped inform me better about the data and how to interpret/relay the information shown.",Very easy and intuitive,"Yes, it explained how the data could be read, so was useful to express this information in my speech","The data sources and verified information was very useful, as was the missing/unverified in order to present a whole and correct interpretation of the data, understanding what it could and couldn't tell one.","Definitely. Some of the visualizations were areas I was unfamiliar with and would have needed background knowledge in - these badges provided key understanding of the data, filling in the gaps for me.",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
footnote,667987c18f34110073ae20b7,mike,,,"Some of the footnotes were not easy to understand without knowing details of the source material (for example, referring to climate models and organisations that produced them in the first visualisation).","I used the footnotes in the first example to understand what the meaning of some of the abbreviations on the bar chart referred to. I did not use footnotes in the second example, as I was able to understand the chart without them.",,"The footnotes helped me interpret the first visualisation, because the chart included acronyms/abbreviations that I did not know. The footnotes mentioned some of these (e.g. SSP = Shared Socioeconomic Pathways), allowing me to interpret the visualisation more easily.",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,55c495d2fdf99b2d6cabb691,lima,,"I actually didn't use them, I didn't think they were a huge part of the charts (I understand that's not the case now)","From some of the labels I had a vague idea what they meant but didn't go into it too much. I didn't realise you could hover click on them for more info, so I expect it would have been easier to understand them if I did this","No I didn't, as I was focusing on the key measures rather than details",N/A,"No, they just kind of added validity to the data in mind, but I didn't use them",,Yes
badge,67d088ccec81d322ccede723,juliet,"I only noticed the badges occasionally, i did not even know they had interractive details.","When I did notice them, they helped clarify what type of information the chart was based on.",The short labels were mostly understandable and detailed.,Partly,,,,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
footnote,67f9613e658e3cf579bf5c25,india,,,It was a little bit hard to understand them.,Yes I considered them because I figured there would be a bit of useful information I could pass on to the boss. ,,I think overall I didn't need them to interpret the data because it wsa straightforward. ,,Yes
footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,,,"It was fairly easy to understand the footnotes. They explained where the data came from and clarified how the different scenarios were calculated. Even though the text was a bit detailed, the main points were clear enough to follow.","Yes, I did. The footnotes helped me understand the context behind the projections, especially how the scenarios were developed and what each organization’s estimates represented. This background made it easier to explain the differences between current policies, 2030 commitments, and long-term net-zero goals.
",,"Absolutely. The footnotes added helpful clarification about the sources and methods used in the chart, which made the projections more meaningful. They gave me confidence in interpreting the numbers and allowed me to explain the visualization in a more accurate and informed way.",no,Yes
badge,676578e9b3ad38588f8808ba,golf,,,i did not understand the meaning of badge well. ,"yes, as it summerises lots by showing data than rephrasing in words.",it was good to understand the data visually than numbers. it is also easier to explain ,not really. it was really technical and hard. I am not familiar with the topic in this depth either,na,Yes
footnote,662e66138060bf4a9db8c159,foxtrot,,,I read the footnotes because the sources and explanations are part of the tool. I don't consider science writing to be easy reading but with plenty of practice I have adjusted to using it. ,"In the second task, I linked the last year of the plot e.g. 2023 to the year of publication e.g. 2024. ",,"In the second task, the year of publication was one year after the last date reported. This is a positive sign the information is as fresh as it could be. ",Science writing is difficult to understand especially for non-scientists. I understand that the methods are integral to having confidence in the results. Knowing something about the methods provides some measure of this confidence. This is where the footnotes come into the visualization tool. ,Yes
badge,60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,echo,"I did not try to hover over any icons or visualisation badges at all, it did not even cross my mind to do so.",N/A,"I glanced at them but did not try to interpret them as I was not aware of what they were, I focused on the graphs specifically.","No, I did not realise what they were nor try to interact with them",N/A,"No, I did not interact with the visualisation badges at all",I might have used the badges if I was more aware of them and their intended purpose,Yes
footnote,6369700320bc7dd22e733009,delta,,,It put the information on the charts into prospective. It wasn't the easiest to understand but it did help to understand what I was looking at.,"Yes, but I used the graphs for most of my input.",,"Yes. It helped me understand what I was viewing. Without the footnotes on the first graph, I would have been wondering what everything meant.",,Yes
footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,,,Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant. ,I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher. ,,"They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization. ",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,"They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.","They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.","Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.","Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.","Most: highlighting uncertainty and multiple sources
Least: copyright and the ones I forgot already",Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.,"I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.",Yes
badge,5101b146-ce6f-4f61-8818-118229a2308b,alpha,,"The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.",Very easy.,Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.,"The ones explaining the labels in the charts (i.e. UNEP, CAT, IEA, etc)..",Yes.,,Yes
