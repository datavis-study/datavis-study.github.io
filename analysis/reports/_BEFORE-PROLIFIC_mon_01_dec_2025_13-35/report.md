🟦 **charlie** (37 words): You can see from this visualization that most governments have changed their behavior in the 2000’s except for that of Asia which has abandoned any semblance of self control on emissions control in the last 20 years.

🟩 **bravo** (64 words): This chart shows annual CO2 emissions by continent through time up to 2023. While Europe and North America have peaked around 2000, Asia is still increasing its emissions rapidly. With about 23 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2023, Asia's emissions have grown to over 4 x that of Europe. Meanwhile, Africa, South America, and Oceania stay around or below 2 billion tonnes per year.

🟩 **alpha** (197 words): This line chart shows annual carbon dioxide emissions data from 1750 to 2023. The x-axis shows years in 50-year steps until 2000; the final step is 23 years. The y-axis shows volume of carbon dioxide in 5-billion steps from 0 to 25 billion tonnes. Asia (the red line) has the largest increase in CO₂ emissions, rising quickly after 1950 to a peak of around 22.5 billion in 2023. North America (brown) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in approx. 2010 of approx. 7 billion and a decrease to approx. 6 billion by 2023. Europe (green) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in the late 1900s of approx. 7.5 billion and a decrease to approx. 5 billion by 2023. Africa (purple), South America (dark red) and Oceania (dark blue) all show modest growth after 1950 rising to approx. 1-2 billion each. The chart offers extra information about the source of the data (Global Carbon Budget (2024) – with major processing by "Our World in Data"), the definition of CO₂ emissions, the license under which others can use this chart (CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) License), and areas of missing data (Land-Use Emissions Not Included).

🟦 **charlie** (48 words): Current policies vs actions taken of all world organizations, who the status of human nature when facing existential crisis. What is said or proposed seems to show that when it comes to actions taken the reality is much lower than what is proposed or said by national governments.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Participants Responses: Global Warming Projection 🟩 Badges</strong> — 2 notes</span></summary>


🟩 **bravo** (73 words): The chart shows multiple global warming scenarios as a projection of the average warming in degrees celsius by 2100. The leftmost group (in grey) shows the different reference scenarios simulated by the IPCC. In the other groups (coloured bars), projections from different sources are shown in each group. These projections align closely with each other, predicting c. 2.6C warming under current policies, 2.4C assuming execution of 2030 commitments, and 1.8C including net-zero promises.

🟩 **alpha** (188 words): This column chart shows how much the global temperature is expected to rise in 2100 according to four different predicted scenarios. The x-axis shows groups that have provided estimates of likely warming outcomes: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Climate Action Tracker (CAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Climate Resource (CR). The x-axis is split into four sections, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that integrate different sets of population, economic growth, and other socioeconomic assumptions into future emissions scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments, and net-zero promises and 2030 commitments. The y-axis shows degrees in Celsius. The different SSPs predict a temperature rise between 1.4 and 4.7 degrees Celsius. With the current policies, UNEP, CAT and IEA predict a temperature rise between 2.6 and 2.7 degrees Celsius. With the 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT and CR predict a temperature rise of around 2.6 degrees Celsius. With the net-zero promises and 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT, IEA and CR predict a temperature rise of around 1.8 degrees Celsius. The chart offers extra information about the data sources used, uncertainty in the data, the time offset, and the fact that these figures are predictions.

**🟩 Badges question:** Additional comments about noticing or interactivity





- **bravo** (14 words): They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>How annotations influenced reading (Badges group only)</strong> — 2 responses</span></summary>






**🟩 Badges question:** If you noticed the visualization badges, describe your experience using them alongside the visualization. Did they influence how you read and interpreted the visualization? If so, how?





- **bravo** (30 words): They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.

- **alpha** (82 words): The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Ease of understanding annotations</strong> — 3 responses</span></summary>


**🟦 Footnotes question:** How easy was it to understand the footnotes?





- **charlie** (26 words): Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant.




**🟩 Badges question:** How easy was it to understand each visualization badge—from the label alone and from the detailed description on hover/click?





- **bravo** (38 words): Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.

- **alpha** (2 words): Very easy.

**🟦 Footnotes question:** Did you consider information in the footnotes for Your Speech? Please explain.





- **charlie** (15 words): I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher.




**🟩 Badges question:** Did you consider information from visualization badges in Your Speech? Please explain.





- **bravo** (5 words): Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.

- **alpha** (20 words): Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.

- **bravo** (14 words): Most: highlighting uncertainty and multiple sources
Least: copyright and the ones I forgot already

- **alpha** (13 words): The ones explaining the labels in the charts (i.e. UNEP, CAT, IEA, etc)..

**🟦 Footnotes question:** Overall, did the footnotes help you understand and interpret the visualization? Please explain.





- **charlie** (12 words): They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization.




**🟩 Badges question:** Overall, did the visualization badges help you understand and interpret the visualization? Please explain.





- **bravo** (11 words): Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.

- **alpha** (1 words): Yes.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Additional comments (Badges group only)</strong> — 1 responses</span></summary>









- **bravo** (78 words): I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.
