🟦 **india (Prolific)** (51 words): In this graph we are presented with annual CO2 emissions in total as categorized by continents. The most alarming statistic from this graph is the level of CO2 emmisions coming from Asia. They are ranked at 22 billion tons, and this is significantly much higher than all the other continents COMBINED.

🟦 **hotel (Prolific)** (94 words): What we’re looking at is the trend of annual CO₂ emissions from 1750 to the present, broken down by world regions. The graph shows a dramatic rise beginning around the mid-20th century, with Asia’s emissions increasing sharply in recent decades. North America and Europe also grew significantly earlier on, though their emissions have started to level off or decline. This visualization highlights two key points: first, global industrial growth has been the driving force behind the surge in emissions, and second, today’s emissions responsibilities are shared across regions, though at different scales and stages.

🟦 **foxtrot (Prolific)** (188 words): Here we have a chart of the annual CO2 emissions broken down by region. On the x-axis we have the years e.g. 1750-2023. This range includes the preindustrial era to the near past. On the y-axis we have the measure of emssions using billions of tons of CO2. The largest emitter is Asia which is over 23 billion tons of CO2. The leading indicator is coal consumption in China. Next we have North America which is measuring 6 tons of CO2. Notice the gradual decrease since 2010. Next we have Europe which measures just above 5 billion tons. Notice again the abrupt decrease since 1980. The next two regions are Africa and South America. These regions measure just below 1 biillion tons of CO1. These regions have not heavily industrialized and therefore have not participated in this global pollution campaign. Last and least is Oceania. This measure is far below 1 billion tons of CO2. The population of Oceania is small compared to the other regions and so this is expected. The source for the data that went into this visualization tool is the Global Carbon Budget (2024).

🟦 **delta (Prolific)** (87 words): Starting around 1850, CO2 emissions began increasing, especially in Asia, North America and Europe. Africa, South America and Oceania has not seen a great increase over time. However, Asia has seen a significant increase in annual CO2 emissions since 1960 and is still on an upward trajectory. Asia emits at least twice as much emissions as any other continent. North America and Europe saw a steady increase in emissions until 1990 and then saw a leveling off and eventually a decrease in emissions starting in approximately 2005.

🟦 **charlie** (37 words): You can see from this visualization that most governments have changed their behavior in the 2000’s except for that of Asia which has abandoned any semblance of self control on emissions control in the last 20 years.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Participants Responses: CO₂ Emissions 🟩 Badges</strong> — 5 notes</span></summary>


🟩 **juliet** (35 words): This chart shows how CO₂ emissions have changed over time across regions. Asian emission has risen overtime and has now become the highest. North America and Europe grew earlier but have leveled off or declined.

🟩 **golf** (175 words): This is a graph of annual CO2 emissions for the approximately last 300 years. It was nearly none in 1750, however it was gradually increasing from 1850, which was resulted in Industrial Revolutions in Great Britain and other western Europe by using coal for factories, manufacturing and so on. However, Europe now has ' European Green Deal' and tries to reduce CO2 emissions, therefore the graph is declining. North America has highly rate of CO2 emissions after Asia. America heveily relys on buring of fossil fuels for factories, cars, and manufacturing. In addition to this, since their economy is very active, CO2 emissions also increase accordingly. Asia is highest produce of CO2 emissions ( red line) especially after 1950. This is mainly because China(number 1) and India ( number 3) became economically very active and these two countries heavily rely on coals.Also these two countries are highest populations in the world so they need more energy for consumption.Also these counties have rich resources for coals. Africa, South America and Oceania keeps lower CO2 emissions meanwhille.

🟩 **echo** (97 words): This is a graph of Annual CO2 emissions, with the X axis displaying the years from 1750 to 2023, and the Y axis showing billion tonnes of emissions. Africa, South America and Oceania all are around a similar output, ranging from 0-3 billion tonnes at the bottom of the graph. Europe and North America are grouped together with a similar trajectory, ranging around 5-7 billion tonnes, with a decrease in value over the last 3 years. Asia is a massively outlier, leading the output with over 20 billion tonnes, having shot up massively since the late 1990's

🟩 **bravo** (64 words): This chart shows annual CO2 emissions by continent through time up to 2023. While Europe and North America have peaked around 2000, Asia is still increasing its emissions rapidly. With about 23 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2023, Asia's emissions have grown to over 4 x that of Europe. Meanwhile, Africa, South America, and Oceania stay around or below 2 billion tonnes per year.

🟩 **alpha** (197 words): This line chart shows annual carbon dioxide emissions data from 1750 to 2023. The x-axis shows years in 50-year steps until 2000; the final step is 23 years. The y-axis shows volume of carbon dioxide in 5-billion steps from 0 to 25 billion tonnes. Asia (the red line) has the largest increase in CO₂ emissions, rising quickly after 1950 to a peak of around 22.5 billion in 2023. North America (brown) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in approx. 2010 of approx. 7 billion and a decrease to approx. 6 billion by 2023. Europe (green) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in the late 1900s of approx. 7.5 billion and a decrease to approx. 5 billion by 2023. Africa (purple), South America (dark red) and Oceania (dark blue) all show modest growth after 1950 rising to approx. 1-2 billion each. The chart offers extra information about the source of the data (Global Carbon Budget (2024) – with major processing by "Our World in Data"), the definition of CO₂ emissions, the license under which others can use this chart (CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) License), and areas of missing data (Land-Use Emissions Not Included).

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Participants Responses: Global Warming Projection 🟦 Footnotes</strong> — 5 notes</span></summary>


🟦 **india (Prolific)** (101 words): Okay so thiss chart holds our 2100 warming predictions for four different scanarios. Clearly we need to look at the impacts from IPCC scanarios, as they result in substantialy higher temperature levels than the other graphs. If we stay with our current policies, we are looking at a higher than average temperature rise than if he did nothing about it. What's even more worrying is that if we stick with out 2030 commimitments, we wont be much better off than if we did nothing at all. Moreover, our net-zero commitments will NOT be met if we continue at the current pace.

🟦 **hotel (Prolific)** (121 words): This chart compares the expected global temperature increase by the year 2100 under different scenarios. On the left, we see the IPCC pathways, which range from nearly 5°C of warming in a worst-case scenario to around 1.4°C if the most ambitious actions are taken. When we shift to the ‘current policies’ column, the numbers rise to around 2.6–2.7°C. This shows that if the world continues with what is already in place, we will fall far short of limiting dangerous warming. The ‘2030 commitments’ improve the outlook slightly, but still keep us above 2°C. The most encouraging column is the ‘net-zero promises plus 2030 commitments,’ which brings warming closer to 1.8°C. This tells us that ambition exists, what’s missing is consistent follow-through.

🟦 **foxtrot (Prolific)** (170 words): Here we see a visualization of projections for the warming planet due to industrial pollution generating greenhouse gases. On the left we have various IPCC scenarios. These correspond to human inputs based on scenarios ranging from strict adherence to climate adaptation e.g. SSP1 to business as usual e.g. SSP5-8.5. Note that business as usual is expected to take the average global temperature to almost 5C or 9F above the preindustrial global average. Next to IPCC, we have Current Policies. These are all below 3C which can still induce tipping points which is a cause for concern going forward. Next to Current Policies are the global 2030 commitments. These are not legally binding but are merely promises made by soveriegn nations to reduce GHG emission to an extent. In essense they are promising to do better in the next five years but only marginally so. On the right, we have net zero promises combined with commitments made for 2030. These are the strictest measures put into place to curb GHG emissions.

🟦 **delta (Prolific)** (65 words): In the IPCC scenarios, we see a steady lowering of temperatures between 4.7C and 1.4C. With our current policies, temperatures will remain steady for each projection at around 2.6C (UNEP, CAT, and IEA). With 2030 commitments, there is a slight decrease in temperatures (down.2 to.3 degrees). With a net-zero promise and 2030 commitments, we will see a.8 -.9 decrease in temperatures across all prediction indicators.

🟦 **charlie** (48 words): Current policies vs actions taken of all world organizations, who the status of human nature when facing existential crisis. What is said or proposed seems to show that when it comes to actions taken the reality is much lower than what is proposed or said by national governments.

🟩 **juliet (Prolific)** (31 words): This chart shows where the world is headed with climate change. it is obvious that if we do very little, temperature could rise upto 5 degree celsius with the current policy.

🟩 **golf (Prolific)** (140 words): This shows the data of 2100 warming projects depending on the senarios. It indicates how climate change will make progress by 2100 depending on the senario. In the first data, according to IPCC, if it is highest emission senario ( SSP5-8.5) degree will be 4.7 degrees higher by 2100. If the senario is the lowest emission ( SSP1-1.9), 1.4degree will be higher by 2100. The second graph is about corrent policies. According to UNEP report, the average of 2.6 degree will be higher. CAT is 2.7 and IEA is 2.6 degrees. The third data is about 2040 commitments. According to the graph, UNEP tries to limit global warming to 2.4 degree and CAt to 2.4 degree too. The last data is net zero promises and 2030 commitments and UNEP, CAT,IEA try to maitain the increase the temprature of 1.8 degrees.

🟩 **echo (Prolific)** (96 words): This is a graph Comparing the latest 2100 warming projections for different scenarios, with the Y axis displaying degrees C, and the X axis displaying a range of IPCC scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments and net-zero promises + 2030 commitments side by side. IPCC scenarios has the highest and lowest values, ranging from 4.7C to 1.4C, and is the highest average overall. This is followed by current policies, then 2030 commitments with the lowest average values being net-zero promises + 2030 commitments. It is apparent there is a downwards trend in values from left to right.

🟩 **bravo** (73 words): The chart shows multiple global warming scenarios as a projection of the average warming in degrees celsius by 2100. The leftmost group (in grey) shows the different reference scenarios simulated by the IPCC. In the other groups (coloured bars), projections from different sources are shown in each group. These projections align closely with each other, predicting c. 2.6C warming under current policies, 2.4C assuming execution of 2030 commitments, and 1.8C including net-zero promises.

🟩 **alpha** (188 words): This column chart shows how much the global temperature is expected to rise in 2100 according to four different predicted scenarios. The x-axis shows groups that have provided estimates of likely warming outcomes: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Climate Action Tracker (CAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Climate Resource (CR). The x-axis is split into four sections, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that integrate different sets of population, economic growth, and other socioeconomic assumptions into future emissions scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments, and net-zero promises and 2030 commitments. The y-axis shows degrees in Celsius. The different SSPs predict a temperature rise between 1.4 and 4.7 degrees Celsius. With the current policies, UNEP, CAT and IEA predict a temperature rise between 2.6 and 2.7 degrees Celsius. With the 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT and CR predict a temperature rise of around 2.6 degrees Celsius. With the net-zero promises and 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT, IEA and CR predict a temperature rise of around 1.8 degrees Celsius. The chart offers extra information about the data sources used, uncertainty in the data, the time offset, and the fact that these figures are predictions.

**🟩 Badges question:** Additional comments about noticing or interactivity





- **juliet (Prolific)** (15 words): I only noticed the badges occasionally, i did not even know they had interractive details.

- **echo (Prolific)** (24 words): I did not try to hover over any icons or visualisation badges at all, it did not even cross my mind to do so.

- **bravo** (14 words): They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>How annotations influenced reading (Badges group only)</strong> — 3 responses</span></summary>






**🟩 Badges question:** If you noticed the visualization badges, describe your experience using them alongside the visualization. Did they influence how you read and interpreted the visualization? If so, how?





- **juliet (Prolific)** (17 words): When I did notice them, they helped clarify what type of information the chart was based on.

- **bravo** (30 words): They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.

- **alpha** (82 words): The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.

**🟦 Footnotes question:** How easy was it to understand the footnotes?





- **india (Prolific)** (9 words): It was a little bit hard to understand them.

- **hotel (Prolific)** (39 words): It was fairly easy to understand the footnotes. They explained where the data came from and clarified how the different scenarios were calculated. Even though the text was a bit detailed, the main points were clear enough to follow.

- **foxtrot (Prolific)** (34 words): I read the footnotes because the sources and explanations are part of the tool. I don't consider science writing to be easy reading but with plenty of practice I have adjusted to using it.

- **delta (Prolific)** (26 words): It put the information on the charts into prospective. It wasn't the easiest to understand but it did help to understand what I was looking at.

- **charlie** (26 words): Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant.




**🟩 Badges question:** How easy was it to understand each visualization badge—from the label alone and from the detailed description on hover/click?





- **juliet (Prolific)** (8 words): The short labels were mostly understandable and detailed.

- **golf (Prolific)** (9 words): i did not understand the meaning of badge well.

- **echo (Prolific)** (26 words): I glanced at them but did not try to interpret them as I was not aware of what they were, I focused on the graphs specifically.

- **bravo** (38 words): Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.

- **alpha** (2 words): Very easy.

**🟦 Footnotes question:** Did you consider information in the footnotes for Your Speech? Please explain.





- **india (Prolific)** (22 words): Yes I considered them because I figured there would be a bit of useful information I could pass on to the boss.

- **hotel (Prolific)** (43 words): Yes, I did. The footnotes helped me understand the context behind the projections, especially how the scenarios were developed and what each organization’s estimates represented. This background made it easier to explain the differences between current policies, 2030 commitments, and long-term net-zero goals.

- **foxtrot (Prolific)** (21 words): In the second task, I linked the last year of the plot e.g. 2023 to the year of publication e.g. 2024.

- **delta (Prolific)** (11 words): Yes, but I used the graphs for most of my input.

- **charlie** (15 words): I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher.




**🟩 Badges question:** Did you consider information from visualization badges in Your Speech? Please explain.





- **juliet (Prolific)** (1 words): Partly

- **golf (Prolific)** (12 words): yes, as it summerises lots by showing data than rephrasing in words.

- **echo (Prolific)** (14 words): No, I did not realise what they were nor try to interact with them

- **bravo** (5 words): Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.

- **alpha** (20 words): Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Overall helpfulness of annotations</strong> — 9 responses</span></summary>


**🟦 Footnotes question:** Overall, did the footnotes help you understand and interpret the visualization? Please explain.





- **india (Prolific)** (15 words): I think overall I didn't need them to interpret the data because it wsa straightforward.

- **hotel (Prolific)** (43 words): Absolutely. The footnotes added helpful clarification about the sources and methods used in the chart, which made the projections more meaningful. They gave me confidence in interpreting the numbers and allowed me to explain the visualization in a more accurate and informed way.

- **foxtrot (Prolific)** (30 words): In the second task, the year of publication was one year after the last date reported. This is a positive sign the information is as fresh as it could be.

- **delta (Prolific)** (24 words): Yes. It helped me understand what I was viewing. Without the footnotes on the first graph, I would have been wondering what everything meant.

- **charlie** (12 words): They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization.




**🟩 Badges question:** Overall, did the visualization badges help you understand and interpret the visualization? Please explain.





- **golf (Prolific)** (19 words): not really. it was really technical and hard. I am not familiar with the topic in this depth either

- **echo (Prolific)** (11 words): No, I did not interact with the visualisation badges at all

- **bravo** (11 words): Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.

- **alpha** (1 words): Yes.

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Additional comments</strong> — 5 responses</span></summary>





- **hotel (Prolific)** (1 words): no

- **foxtrot (Prolific)** (43 words): Science writing is difficult to understand especially for non-scientists. I understand that the methods are integral to having confidence in the results. Knowing something about the methods provides some measure of this confidence. This is where the footnotes come into the visualization tool.







- **golf (Prolific)** (1 words): na

- **echo (Prolific)** (17 words): I might have used the badges if I was more aware of them and their intended purpose

- **bravo** (78 words): I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.
