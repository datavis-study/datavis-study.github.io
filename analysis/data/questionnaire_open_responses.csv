badge,67d088ccec81d322ccede723,juliet,"I only noticed the badges occasionally, i did not even know they had interractive details.","When I did notice them, they helped clarify what type of information the chart was based on.",The short labels were mostly understandable and detailed.,Partly,,,,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
footnote,67f9613e658e3cf579bf5c25,india,,,It was a little bit hard to understand them.,Yes I considered them because I figured there would be a bit of useful information I could pass on to the boss. ,,I think overall I didn't need them to interpret the data because it wsa straightforward. ,,Yes
footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,,,"It was fairly easy to understand the footnotes. They explained where the data came from and clarified how the different scenarios were calculated. Even though the text was a bit detailed, the main points were clear enough to follow.","Yes, I did. The footnotes helped me understand the context behind the projections, especially how the scenarios were developed and what each organization’s estimates represented. This background made it easier to explain the differences between current policies, 2030 commitments, and long-term net-zero goals.
",,"Absolutely. The footnotes added helpful clarification about the sources and methods used in the chart, which made the projections more meaningful. They gave me confidence in interpreting the numbers and allowed me to explain the visualization in a more accurate and informed way.",no,Yes
badge,676578e9b3ad38588f8808ba,golf,,,i did not understand the meaning of badge well. ,"yes, as it summerises lots by showing data than rephrasing in words.",it was good to understand the data visually than numbers. it is also easier to explain ,not really. it was really technical and hard. I am not familiar with the topic in this depth either,na,Yes
footnote,662e66138060bf4a9db8c159,foxtrot,,,I read the footnotes because the sources and explanations are part of the tool. I don't consider science writing to be easy reading but with plenty of practice I have adjusted to using it. ,"In the second task, I linked the last year of the plot e.g. 2023 to the year of publication e.g. 2024. ",,"In the second task, the year of publication was one year after the last date reported. This is a positive sign the information is as fresh as it could be. ",Science writing is difficult to understand especially for non-scientists. I understand that the methods are integral to having confidence in the results. Knowing something about the methods provides some measure of this confidence. This is where the footnotes come into the visualization tool. ,Yes
badge,60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,echo,"I did not try to hover over any icons or visualisation badges at all, it did not even cross my mind to do so.",N/A,"I glanced at them but did not try to interpret them as I was not aware of what they were, I focused on the graphs specifically.","No, I did not realise what they were nor try to interact with them",N/A,"No, I did not interact with the visualisation badges at all",I might have used the badges if I was more aware of them and their intended purpose,Yes
footnote,6369700320bc7dd22e733009,delta,,,It put the information on the charts into prospective. It wasn't the easiest to understand but it did help to understand what I was looking at.,"Yes, but I used the graphs for most of my input.",,"Yes. It helped me understand what I was viewing. Without the footnotes on the first graph, I would have been wondering what everything meant.",,Yes
footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,,,Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant. ,I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher. ,,"They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization. ",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,"They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.","They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.","Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.","Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.","Most: highlighting uncertainty and multiple sources
Least: copyright and the ones I forgot already",Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.,"I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.",Yes
badge,5101b146-ce6f-4f61-8818-118229a2308b,alpha,,"The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.",Very easy.,Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.,"The ones explaining the labels in the charts (i.e. UNEP, CAT, IEA, etc)..",Yes.,,Yes
