badge,60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,echo,"I did not try to hover over any icons or visualisation badges at all, it did not even cross my mind to do so.",N/A,"I glanced at them but did not try to interpret them as I was not aware of what they were, I focused on the graphs specifically.","No, I did not realise what they were nor try to interact with them",N/A,"No, I did not interact with the visualisation badges at all",I might have used the badges if I was more aware of them and their intended purpose,Yes
footnote,6369700320bc7dd22e733009,delta,,,It put the information on the charts into prospective. It wasn't the easiest to understand but it did help to understand what I was looking at.,"Yes, but I used the graphs for most of my input.",,"Yes. It helped me understand what I was viewing. Without the footnotes on the first graph, I would have been wondering what everything meant.",,Yes
footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,,,Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant. ,I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher. ,,"They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization. ",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,"They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.","They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.","Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.","Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.","Most: highlighting uncertainty and multiple sources
Least: copyright and the ones I forgot already",Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.,"I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.",Yes
badge,5101b146-ce6f-4f61-8818-118229a2308b,alpha,,"The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.",Very easy.,Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.,"The ones explaining the labels in the charts (i.e. UNEP, CAT, IEA, etc)..",Yes.,,Yes
