footnote,9a73ce92-5365-411d-a81d-1db38ff72f4e,echo,,,"Not easy, I forgot what the footnotes were about for the emission chart because I did not take a close look. For the first one about warming projections, because I did not understand the chart axis so I read the footnotes. But still it is difficult to understand because the font is really small and a bit off-putting to read small, technically written text.","I considered the footnotes in the first chart because it helped me at least a little bit in understanding the terminology presented in the x-axis. I'm not confident about what I put in the speech text though, for I don't think I understand clear enough about those terms. The second chart I did not use information in the footnotes, I took a glance it was about the data collection and calculations, I was describing the trends in the line charts so I did not use it.  ",,"If the visualisation looks confusing to me, requires a lot of contextual information like the first one, then I make more effort to process the information in the footnotes. If not really complicated then I took a glance to decide if I want to read more about it. I think footnote is rarely noticeable and really need some effort, so I try to avoid unless I really need more information. But if the footnote is written in a very technical style I get upset, they have more space to put complete sentences (!!) should be in plain english. ",generally speaking I believe more contextual information is better than nothing at all that's why I gave a 4 for the last question.,Yes
footnote,2b69160b-3a1e-4ad9-9039-f3758f20b569,foxtrot,,,"The first one was quite clear.
For the second example, a lot of context information should have been present ahead of the chart instead of just on footnotes.","Yes, it helped me understood what I was looking on and so, what to write, especially on the second chart.",,"Yes, as I stated previously it helped me understood what I was looking on",,Yes
badge,37b66c79-da74-498e-9567-c79c5d7efd41,delta,"I spontaneously hovered over the warning badges much more often than the informative ones.
My attention was more focused on the data.","For one of the charts, I noticed a badge indicating that some of the data was somewhat outdated. For the elements displayed, it made sense to mention this in the description.",I didn't read everything but the one I read was very easy to understand and I was happy that the description was short.,Only in the case mentioned above — the one where the data might be outdated.,"As mentioned above, I didn't really pay attention to the blue badges. I mainly noticed the warnings. ","The badges helped to contextualize the visualization but I wouldn't say that it helped understanding it. 
I was happy to have access to this additionnal data in such a way that didn't overwhelmed the chart.",,Yes
footnote,4798e3dc-4588-41b2-8e23-9f43d695c79e,charlie,,,"Not easy enough for me to continue reading them after I realized I did not have some of the vocabulary nor understood most of the abbreviations which weren't explained (and mostly had to guess what they meant along the way, especially for the IPCC scenario stuff).","not at all. For the bar chart, since I could not make out what everything meant, I would not use an information I can't fully understand.",,The only way it did was for the bar chart to give me some clues as what could be the meaning of the acronyms.,"Footnotes are only useful to their destined audience. If the goal is to help people from any background understand it, it should hold all the disambiguation needed to even comprehend the footnote itself. Otherwise it just excludes the profanes. ",Yes
badge,0b6ad5e0-be61-411e-980c-c773e0482c66,bravo,,"When it was positive, I did not mentioned it, but when it was negative, I said so in the text box. ",Easy,Yes,I don't remember ,"Not really, it just triggers some critical thinking ",,Yes
badge,6a223d18-f389-4312-a78f-38ca9bbbd583,alpha,I only noticed the interactivity until the last chart. ,They point out some details I missed when I only read the charts. ,"With a detailed description, it is relatively easy. With only badges, I understand most of them, but a few.","After I noticed these badges, I would warn people about potential misunderstandings of the data and also double-verify my findings in my speech. ","So far, I consider that every badge conveys meaningful warnings or extra information. Those red (yellow) and blue badges are relatively more useful than green badges for me to examine my interpretations of the chart.",They point out some details I missed when I only read the charts. ,,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
