footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,,,Too many acronyms or letter combinations. I almost felt like I needed to go out and get a definition so I could understand what they meant. ,I didnt really consider that the answers would be there. This seemed hard to decipher. ,,"They helped, but I spent more time on looking at the visualization. ",,Sometimes (I did not consistently check)
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,"They were well-designed, not getting in the way, but there when I was interested.","They reminded me that some data was only based on predictions and there was uncertainty between data sources. I also found information about copyright, but I wasn't interested in that.","Some of them were easy to understand by the face of them (e.g. multiple data sources), others (e.g. copyright) weren't but gave a good sense of what information was to be found when you would click on them.","Yes, I emphasised the uncertainty.","Most: highlighting uncertainty and multiple sources
Least: copyright and the ones I forgot already",Yes. They made me aware of the limitations of the chart.,"I think some of these badges would highlight potential issues in a visualisation that you would not have when you are aware of these issues. So, on one hand I think using them as a checklist while you make your visualisation even helps making a better chart, but on the other hand this will not fix most problematic visualisations on the internet because ignorant people won't use these badges either. In general, I think they are mostly helpful.",Yes
badge,5101b146-ce6f-4f61-8818-118229a2308b,alpha,,"The visualization badges being interactive were very helpful in providing context and extra information to interprest the chart, especially in judging its accuracy and relevance. By providing this extra information I could check the data myself (although I didn't in these exercises). I assumed they were important to understand the data being visualised but they did not change my interpretation of the visualisations - I imagine they would if climate change was an area I knew a lot about / worked in.",Very easy.,Yes. I assumed the information from the visualisation badges was important to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data.,"The ones explaining the labels in the charts (i.e. UNEP, CAT, IEA, etc)..",Yes.,,Yes
