badge,67eee89119de070d8b864f60,tango,co2-emissions,"Asia's recent and spectacular rise, which accelerated after 2000 to become the major emitter by far and currently surpasses all other regions combined, is the most dramatic story.  North America and Europe display a different long-term pattern. They industrialized early, with emissions peaking in the late 20th century, and have recently began to exhibit a little fall or plateau.  The regions of Africa, South America, and Oceania have supplied a very tiny amount historically, while Africa's line is beginning to trend upward. The larger picture is a huge geographic shift: the center of emissions has migrated decisively from the early-industrializing West to Asia in the 21st century, even as the world total continues to increase."
badge,67eee89119de070d8b864f60,tango,global-warming-projection,"The important takeaway is our action gap. If we continue on our present policies track, we are destined for a median warming of roughly 2.6°C, with a high-end risk of 3.6°C.  However, assuming all net-zero promises and 2030 commitments are fully implemented—the blue band—we can drastically limit the range. The median drops to 1.8°C, placing the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C objective within the lower threshold of uncertainty.  The contrast is startling. Fulfilling all obligations gives us a solid chance to stay below 2°C. Failing to apply them locks in a significantly riskier road above 2.5°C. Our focus must be on closing this implementation gap to move from the current policies outcome to the desired one."

The emissions scale runs from 0 to 25 billion in 5 billion increments. All continents show zero or close to zero until approximately 1850. Following this date North American and European emissions begin to rise, reaching 5 billion around 1950. They begin to decline in recent years. Asia only began to slowly rise after 1900, until around 1950 when it's emissions increased to over 20 billion by 2023. The remaining continents show a slow rise from 1950 to the 2023."

Quite strikingly, Asia has both the sharpest increase in emissions from shortly after the 1950s, but also a considerably higher total emissions than all other continents, its total in fact being more than twice that of any other continent. All other continents have shown increases in emissions from around the same time, with North America and Europe being the next worst offenders. These latter two however have shown a decrease in emissions over the past twenty years or so, something which Asia has not."

These are grouped into four groups: IPCC scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments, net-zero promises and 2030 commitments. Within each grouping are projections by different groups such as UNEP and CAT. The graph shows that the 2030 commitments show a slight decrease in warming projections compared to current policies, from around an increase of 2.6 degrees to 2.4 degrees. It shows further that these commitments along with net-zero promises show a further decrease in the warming projections, down to around 1.8 degrees."

It remains low until the mid 20th century after which the emissions accelerate rapidly. By 2023, Asia emits above 20 billion tonnes more than all other regions.  Regions like Africa, South America and Oceania remain low emitters but they also show gradual increases over time.  North America and Europe show a different pattern, they experienced increase in emissions from 1850 to late 20th century. From there their emissions have declined slightly.  Overall, global emissions profile has shifted over the past few decades: North America and Europe were the dominant emitters but as of today Asia is by far the largest contributor to annual CO2 emission."

The next section shows that if countries fully carry out their 2030 commitments, projection would slightly improve to 2.4C but this falls short of the required temperature threshold for avoiding severe climate impacts.  The final section estimates the impacts if we combine the Net zero promises with 2030 commitments. It shows that if these are fully implemented and achieved on time, the warming would reduce to 18.

The grey bars on the left show projections based on each of the 5 Socioeconomic pathways by IPCC. These indicate that the scenarios represented by the smaller bars will have more of an impact on global temperature increases.  The coloured bars in the remainder of the chart represent outcomes in terms of warming based on current policies, 2030 commitments and Net-zero promises plus 2030 commitments respectively. This shows that Net zero commitments plus 2030 commitments could limit warming to around 1.8C, whereas current policies or 2030 commitments alone could see increases up to around 2.7C.  Overall, the chart highlights the differences between current policies and potential based on net zero promises plus 2030 commitments.

At this point, emissions start increasing in Europe, followed by North America, gradually increasing until the 1950s when emissions increase more steeply. At the same time, emissions start to increase from all other regions, with Asia's dramatically increasing.  Europe and North America's emissions peaked during the 20th century, with decline in values from the late 20th century onwards.

Clearly we need to look at the impacts from IPCC scanarios, as they result in substantialy higher temperature levels than the other graphs. If we stay with our current policies, we are looking at a higher than average temperature rise than if he did nothing about it. What's even more worrying is that if we stick with out 2030 commimitments, we wont be much better off than if we did nothing at all. Moreover, our net-zero commitments will NOT be met if we continue at the current pace."

footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,co2-emissions,"What we’re looking at is the trend of annual CO₂ emissions from 1750 to the present, broken down by world regions. The graph shows a dramatic rise beginning around the mid-20th century, with Asia’s emissions increasing sharply in recent decades. North America and Europe also grew significantly earlier on, though their emissions have started to level off or decline.  This visualization highlights two key points: first, global industrial growth has been the driving force behind the surge in emissions, and second, today’s emissions responsibilities are shared across regions, though at different scales and stages."
footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,global-warming-projection,"This chart compares the expected global temperature increase by the year 2100 under different scenarios. On the left, we see the IPCC pathways, which range from nearly 5°C of warming in a worst-case scenario to around 1.4°C if the most ambitious actions are taken.  When we shift to the ‘current policies’ column, the numbers rise to around 2.6–2.7°C. This shows that if the world continues with what is already in place, we will fall far short of limiting dangerous warming. The ‘2030 commitments’ improve the outlook slightly, but still keep us above 2°C.  The most encouraging column is the ‘net-zero promises plus 2030 commitments,’ which brings warming closer to 1.8°C. This tells us that ambition exists, what’s missing is consistent follow-through."

It was nearly none in 1750, however it was gradually increasing from 1850, which was resulted in Industrial Revolutions in Great Britain and other western Europe by using coal for factories, manufacturing and so on. However, Europe now has ' European Green Deal' and tries to reduce CO2 emissions, therefore the graph is declining. North America has highly rate of CO2 emissions after Asia. America heveily relys on buring of fossil fuels for factories, cars, and manufacturing. In addition to this, since their economy is very active, CO2 emissions also increase accordingly. Asia is highest produce of CO2 emissions ( red line) especially after 1950. This is mainly because China(number 1) and India ( number 3) became economically very active and these two countries heavily rely on coals.Also these two countries are highest populations in the world so they need more energy for consumption.Also these counties have rich resources for coals. Africa, South America and Oceania keeps lower CO2 emissions meanwhille."

In the first data, according to IPCC, if it is highest emission senario ( SSP5-8.5) degree will be 4.7 degrees higher by 2100. If the senario is the lowest emission ( SSP1-1.9), 1.4degree will be higher by 2100. The second graph is about corrent policies. According to UNEP report, the average of 2.6 degree will be higher. CAT is 2.7 and IEA is 2.6 degrees. The third data is about 2040 commitments. According to the graph, UNEP tries to limit global warming to 2.4 degree and CAt to 2.4 degree too.

On the left we have various IPCC scenarios. These correspond to human inputs based on scenarios ranging from strict adherence to climate adaptation e.g. SSP1 to business as usual e.g. SSP5-8.5. Note that business as usual is expected to take the average global temperature to almost 5C or 9F above the preindustrial global average. Next to IPCC, we have Current Policies. These are all below 3C which can still induce tipping points which is a cause for concern going forward. Next to Current Policies are the global 2030 commitments. These are not legally binding but are merely promises made by soveriegn nations to reduce GHG emission to an extent. In essense they are promising to do better in the next five years but only marginally so. On the right, we have net zero promises combined with commitments made for 2030. These are the strictest measures put into place to curb GHG emissions."

The largest emitter is Asia which is over 23 billion tons of CO2. The leading indicator is coal consumption in China. Next we have North America which is measuring 6 tons of CO2. Notice the gradual decrease since 2010. Next we have Europe which measures just above 5 billion tons. Notice again the abrupt decrease since 1980. The next two regions are Africa and South America. These regions measure just below 1 biillion tons of CO1. These regions have not heavily industrialized and therefore have not participated in this global pollution campaign. Last and least is Oceania. This measure is far below 1 billion tons of CO2. The population of Oceania is small compared to the other regions and so this is expected.
