footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,global-warming-projection,"Current policies vs actions taken of all world organizations, who the status of human nature when facing existential crisis. What is said or proposed seems to show that when it comes to actions taken the reality is much lower than what is proposed or said by national governments."
footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,co2-emissions,You can see from this visualization that most governments have changed their behavior in the 2000’s except for that of Asia which has abandoned any semblance of self control on emissions control in the last 20 years.
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,global-warming-projection,"The chart shows multiple global warming scenarios as a projection of the average warming in degrees celsius by 2100.  The leftmost group (in grey) shows the different reference scenarios simulated by the IPCC. In the other groups (coloured bars), projections from different sources are shown in each group. These projections align closely with each other, predicting c. 2.6C warming under current policies, 2.4C assuming execution of 2030 commitments, and 1.8C including net-zero promises."
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,co2-emissions,"This chart shows annual CO2 emissions by continent through time up to 2023. While Europe and North America have peaked around 2000, Asia is still increasing its emissions rapidly. With about 23 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2023, Asia's emissions have grown to over 4 x that of Europe. Meanwhile, Africa, South America, and Oceania stay around or below 2 billion tonnes per year."
badge,5101b146-ce6f-4f61-8818-118229a2308b,alpha,co2-emissions,"This line chart shows annual carbon dioxide emissions data from 1750 to 2023. The x-axis shows years in 50-year steps until 2000; the final step is 23 years.  The y-axis shows volume of carbon dioxide in 5-billion steps from 0 to 25 billion tonnes. Asia (the red line) has the largest increase in CO₂ emissions, rising quickly after 1950 to a peak of around 22.5 billion in 2023.  North America (brown) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in approx. 2010 of approx. 7 billion and a decrease to approx. 6 billion by 2023.  Europe (green) shows an increase from 1850 with a peak in the late 1900s of approx. 7.5 billion and a decrease to approx. 5 billion by 2023.  Africa (purple), South America (dark red) and Oceania (dark blue) all show modest growth after 1950 rising to approx. 1-2 billion each.  The chart offers extra information about the source of the data (Global Carbon Budget (2024) – with major processing by ""Our World in Data""), the definition of CO₂ emissions, the license under which others can use this chart (CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) License), and areas of missing data (Land-Use Emissions Not Included)."

The x-axis shows groups that have provided estimates of likely warming outcomes: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Climate Action Tracker (CAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Climate Resource (CR). The x-axis is split into four sections, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that integrate different sets of population, economic growth, and other socioeconomic assumptions into future emissions scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments, and net-zero promises and 2030 commitments.  The y-axis shows degrees in Celsius.  The different SSPs predict a temperature rise between 1.4 and 4.7 degrees Celsius.  With the current policies, UNEP, CAT and IEA predict a temperature rise between 2.6 and 2.7 degrees Celsius.  With the 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT and CR predict a temperature rise of around 2.6 degrees Celsius.  With the net-zero promises and 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT, IEA and CR predict a temperature rise of around 1.8 degrees Celsius.  The chart offers extra information about the data sources used, uncertainty in the data, the time offset, and the fact that these figures are predictions."
