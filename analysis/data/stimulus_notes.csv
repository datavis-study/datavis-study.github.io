badge,67d088ccec81d322ccede723,juliet,global-warming-projection,"This chart shows where the world is headed with climate change. it is obvious that if we do very little, temperature could rise upto 5 degree celsius with the current policy."
badge,67d088ccec81d322ccede723,juliet,co2-emissions,This chart shows how CO₂ emissions have changed over time across regions. Asian emission has risen overtime and has now become the highest. North America and Europe grew earlier but have leveled off or declined.
footnote,67f9613e658e3cf579bf5c25,india,global-warming-projection,"Okay so thiss chart holds our 2100 warming predictions for four different scanarios. Clearly we need to look at the impacts from IPCC scanarios, as they result in substantialy higher temperature levels than the other graphs. If we stay with our current policies, we are looking at a higher than average temperature rise than if he did nothing about it. What's even more worrying is that if we stick with out 2030 commimitments, we wont be much better off than if we did nothing at all. Moreover, our net-zero commitments will NOT be met if we continue at the current pace."
footnote,67f9613e658e3cf579bf5c25,india,co2-emissions,"In this graph we are presented with annual CO2 emissions in total as categorized by continents. The most alarming statistic from this graph is the level of CO2 emmisions coming from Asia. They are ranked at 22 billion tons, and this is significantly much higher than all the other continents COMBINED."
footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,co2-emissions,"What we’re looking at is the trend of annual CO₂ emissions from 1750 to the present, broken down by world regions. The graph shows a dramatic rise beginning around the mid-20th century, with Asia’s emissions increasing sharply in recent decades. North America and Europe also grew significantly earlier on, though their emissions have started to level off or decline.  This visualization highlights two key points: first, global industrial growth has been the driving force behind the surge in emissions, and second, today’s emissions responsibilities are shared across regions, though at different scales and stages."
footnote,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,hotel,global-warming-projection,"This chart compares the expected global temperature increase by the year 2100 under different scenarios. On the left, we see the IPCC pathways, which range from nearly 5°C of warming in a worst-case scenario to around 1.4°C if the most ambitious actions are taken.  When we shift to the ‘current policies’ column, the numbers rise to around 2.6–2.7°C. This shows that if the world continues with what is already in place, we will fall far short of limiting dangerous warming. The ‘2030 commitments’ improve the outlook slightly, but still keep us above 2°C.  The most encouraging column is the ‘net-zero promises plus 2030 commitments,’ which brings warming closer to 1.8°C. This tells us that ambition exists, what’s missing is consistent follow-through."
badge,676578e9b3ad38588f8808ba,golf,co2-emissions,"This is a graph of annual CO2 emissions for the approximately last 300 years. It was nearly none in 1750, however it was gradually increasing from 1850, which was resulted in Industrial Revolutions in Great Britain and other western Europe by using coal for factories, manufacturing and so on. However, Europe now has ' European Green Deal' and tries to reduce CO2 emissions, therefore the graph is declining. North America has highly rate of CO2 emissions after Asia. America heveily relys on buring of fossil fuels for factories, cars, and manufacturing. In addition to this, since their economy is very active, CO2 emissions also increase accordingly. Asia is highest produce of CO2 emissions ( red line) especially after 1950. This is mainly because China(number 1) and India ( number 3) became economically very active and these two countries heavily rely on coals.Also these two countries are highest populations in the world so they need more energy for consumption.Also these counties have rich resources for coals. Africa, South America and Oceania keeps lower CO2 emissions meanwhille."
badge,676578e9b3ad38588f8808ba,golf,global-warming-projection,"This shows the data of 2100 warming projects depending on the senarios. It indicates how climate change will make progress by 2100 depending on the senario. In the first data, according to IPCC, if it is highest emission senario ( SSP5-8.5) degree will be 4.7 degrees higher by 2100. If the senario is the lowest emission ( SSP1-1.9), 1.4degree will be higher by 2100. The second graph is about corrent policies. According to UNEP report, the average of 2.6 degree will be higher. CAT is 2.7 and IEA is 2.6 degrees. The third data is about 2040 commitments. According to the graph, UNEP tries to limit global warming to 2.4 degree and CAt to 2.4 degree too. The last data is net zero promises and 2030 commitments and UNEP, CAT,IEA try to maitain the increase the temprature of 1.8 degrees."
footnote,662e66138060bf4a9db8c159,foxtrot,global-warming-projection,"Here we see a visualization of projections for the warming planet due to industrial pollution generating greenhouse gases. On the left we have various IPCC scenarios. These correspond to human inputs based on scenarios ranging from strict adherence to climate adaptation e.g. SSP1 to business as usual e.g. SSP5-8.5. Note that business as usual is expected to take the average global temperature to almost 5C or 9F above the preindustrial global average. Next to IPCC, we have Current Policies. These are all below 3C which can still induce tipping points which is a cause for concern going forward. Next to Current Policies are the global 2030 commitments. These are not legally binding but are merely promises made by soveriegn nations to reduce GHG emission to an extent. In essense they are promising to do better in the next five years but only marginally so. On the right, we have net zero promises combined with commitments made for 2030. These are the strictest measures put into place to curb GHG emissions."
footnote,662e66138060bf4a9db8c159,foxtrot,co2-emissions,Here we have a chart of the annual CO2 emissions broken down by region. On the x-axis we have the years e.g. 1750-2023. This range includes the preindustrial era to the near past. On the y-axis we have the measure of emssions using billions of tons of CO2. The largest emitter is Asia which is over 23 billion tons of CO2. The leading indicator is coal consumption in China. Next we have North America which is measuring 6 tons of CO2. Notice the gradual decrease since 2010. Next we have Europe which measures just above 5 billion tons. Notice again the abrupt decrease since 1980. The next two regions are Africa and South America. These regions measure just below 1 biillion tons of CO1. These regions have not heavily industrialized and therefore have not participated in this global pollution campaign. Last and least is Oceania. This measure is far below 1 billion tons of CO2. The population of Oceania is small compared to the other regions and so this is expected. The source for the data that went into this visualization tool is the Global Carbon Budget (2024).

Africa, South America and Oceania all are around a similar output, ranging from 0-3 billion tonnes at the bottom of the graph. Europe and North America are grouped together with a similar trajectory, ranging around 5-7 billion tonnes, with a decrease in value over the last 3 years. Asia is a massively outlier, leading the output with over 20 billion tonnes, having shot up massively since the late 1990's"

IPCC scenarios has the highest and lowest values, ranging from 4.7C to 1.4C, and is the highest average overall. This is followed by current policies, then 2030 commitments with the lowest average values being net-zero promises + 2030 commitments. It is apparent there is a downwards trend in values from left to right."
footnote,6369700320bc7dd22e733009,delta,global-warming-projection,"In the IPCC scenarios, we see a steady lowering of temperatures between 4.7C and 1.4C. With our current policies, temperatures will remain steady for each projection at around 2.6C (UNEP, CAT, and IEA). With 2030 commitments, there is a slight decrease in temperatures (down.2 to.3 degrees). With a net-zero promise and 2030 commitments, we will see a.8 -.9 decrease in temperatures across all prediction indicators."
footnote,6369700320bc7dd22e733009,delta,co2-emissions,"Starting around 1850, CO2 emissions began increasing, especially in Asia, North America and Europe. Africa, South America and Oceania has not seen a great increase over time. However, Asia has seen a significant increase in annual CO2 emissions since 1960 and is still on an upward trajectory. Asia emits at least twice as much emissions as any other continent. North America and Europe saw a steady increase in emissions until 1990 and then saw a leveling off and eventually a decrease in emissions starting in approximately 2005."

What is said or proposed seems to show that when it comes to actions taken the reality is much lower than what is proposed or said by national governments."
footnote,7b88dea0-0445-4362-b670-01be60f5195b,charlie,co2-emissions,You can see from this visualization that most governments have changed their behavior in the 2000’s except for that of Asia which has abandoned any semblance of self control on emissions control in the last 20 years.
badge,782e2f94-ade5-4279-94aa-9dcdb26abbcd,bravo,global-warming-projection,"The chart shows multiple global warming scenarios as a projection of the average warming in degrees celsius by 2100.  The leftmost group (in grey) shows the different reference scenarios simulated by the IPCC. In the other groups (coloured bars), projections from different sources are shown in each group. These projections align closely with each other, predicting c. 2.6C warming under current policies, 2.4C assuming execution of 2030 commitments, and 1.8C including net-zero promises."

The x-axis shows groups that have provided estimates of likely warming outcomes: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Climate Action Tracker (CAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Climate Resource (CR). The x-axis is split into four sections, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that integrate different sets of population, economic growth, and other socioeconomic assumptions into future emissions scenarios, current policies, 2030 commitments, and net-zero promises and 2030 commitments.  The y-axis shows degrees in Celsius.  The different SSPs predict a temperature rise between 1.4 and 4.7 degrees Celsius.  With the current policies, UNEP, CAT and IEA predict a temperature rise between 2.6 and 2.7 degrees Celsius.  With the 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT and CR predict a temperature rise of around 2.6 degrees Celsius.  With the net-zero promises and 2030 commitments, UNEP, CAT, IEA and CR predict a temperature rise of around 1.8 degrees Celsius.  The chart offers extra information about the data sources used, uncertainty in the data, the time offset, and the fact that these figures are predictions."
