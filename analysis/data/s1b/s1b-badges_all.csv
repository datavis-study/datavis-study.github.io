It is more difficult to answer any specific questions because you have to read through the whole text as opposed to hovering over the section you have the most questions about, like you can with the visualisation badges.

The information feels a lot less dense this way and is easier to read,176423.0,1,3,"Footnotes are okay and do provide a lot of extra context and useful information, but are a lot harder to read through and extract more specific information you are looking for.

I find it clearer to have all the information on one page. The image with footnotes is that image, whereas the first image hides information from the viewer; I can't see that as being a preferable way to present information. ",135573.0,I prefer the version with footnotes (left),"Well, for almost exactly the same reasons as above. I find it a clearer way of presenting the information, so obviously I would find it a clearer way of presenting and explaining the information to others. Maybe the first image would be clearer if the different ""sections"" of info as indicated by the badges in image 2 were on separate lines rather than in one paragraph, but regardless the first image is clearer. ",I prefer the version with footnotes (left),"Because the version with footnotes contains all the information you need, rather than having to go to the effort of finding it, or with the risk of possibly missing it, as I did with the badges in the previous task. It's just clearer to have all the information presented in one image rather than portioned out in various different places.

I feel the more interactive aspect is much more engaging as information rather than a chunky block of dry data regarding the specifics of the graphic. ,I prefer the version with visualization badges (left),"Same reasons as the last one, I just think that it is much easier to digest the information in smaller, more relevant chunks than it is with a complicated text block which isn't particularly entertaining text, just very fry and functional because it is to do with the data.

I think big blocks of text like that people switch off, but if you narrow down the relevance then it is easier for people to grasp an understanding of what the text is about.",I prefer the version with visualization badges (right),The text block is too long and complicated to read. The visualisations break the text down into labels in more bite size chunks and have information that is relevant to the label. I feel like it is easier to digest and therefore easier to understand.
