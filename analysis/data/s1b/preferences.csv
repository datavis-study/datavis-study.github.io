badges,55c495d2fdf99b2d6cabb691,badges,"Although there is less information and detail conveyed in the badges than the footnotes, it is quicker and easier to understand the important things. Also I think a chart is made for the purpose of understanding and communicating data quickly, so the badges are better suited as they are in line with this",badges,"I would prefer the badges in this scenario because I wouldn't want to read a footnote or parts of a footnote. I could present the badges as part of the other parts of the charts, and I would feel like the audience would prefer this too",badges,"The same reasons as before, it is quicker and easier to get the main points from the badges rather than the footnotes. The footnote is a bit too lengthy and take away from the aim of the chart which is to convey data quickly in an understood manner",badges,"Again the same as before, as it would be easiest to refer to the badges rather than the footnotes when presenting / explaining it. I wouldn't want to read the entire footnote out, and getting the main points from the footnote would not be as easy as it would be with the badges"
badges,65537e14439274fe5036b4d2,badges,"I prefer the visualisation on the right, as it provides the level of detail I need to understand the information.  It does not feel cluttered and looks cleaner and more organised than the visual on the left.  It also, from memory, actually contains more information than the visualisation on the left, as each box can be hovered over to provide further insights.",badges,"I prefer the visualisation on the right for presentation.  It feels more professional and modern.  It has less going on, which keeps the audience's eyes on the information I want to get across.  It also again feels less cluttered and more inkeeping with the most professional presentations are now done.  The visualisation on the left feels dated by comparison, and the footnotes would be distracting for most people.",badges,"I prefer the visualisation on the left as it feels less cluttered and helps your eyes focus on the most important details.  Footnotes, in my opinion, are not used by most audiences and at best would be used as a quick reference.  With that in mind, having them as boxes that you can hover over and then ignore is the superior way to present the information.",badges,"I prefer the visualisation on the left as it is more professional and more inkeeping with the way the presentations are now shown to large audiences.  Most people are like graphs that are simple to interpret and immediately convey the information.  Having footnotes acts as a distraction, and being able to tidy them up enables the information to still be present without interfering with the overall messaging that is being shown.  The footnotes should never be more than supporting information."
badges,55eb4774748092000baa97ee,badges,I felt like the footnotes were seemed like a disclaimer and it was a lot on the eye along with all of the other information being presented. I like the badges because they're clear on what information they'll be presenting and they give the opportunity to take it one data source at a time. ,no_preference,"I want to say that I'd prefer the badges because they're clear and to the point, however the footnotes might be easier to explain data when I'm presenting a meeting. I can review all of the data all at once. I don't have a clear preferance, however I feel with the footnotes I'd be giving more of a speech where as with the badges, I'd be presenting key facts individually. ",badges,"I like this type of visualization a lot better! I find the information much more clear and easy to take in so for the footnotes versus badges, my preference is only slight for badges. I just feel like it's feel like it's presented in a clearer format. ",no_preference,I feel I could explain present this data very well with either the footnotes or the badges. I'd prefer the badges if I was presenting on my laptop screen and the footnotes if I was using slides. 
badges,60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,badges,It is a lot easier to take in and understand the information by separating the information in to different visualisation badges then hovering the mouse over them to read them. The information feels a lot less dense this way and is easier to read,badges,"It looks a lot cleaner and more presentable with the visualisation badges. When explaining to others you can hover over each badge individually, and it helps to separate the information in to categories for those being presented to, helping to understand the information more clearly.",badges,"The information is compact and dense with the footnotes on the right. It is more difficult to answer any specific questions because you have to read through the whole text as opposed to hovering over the section you have the most questions about, like you can with the visualisation badges. ",badges,"It is easier to separate your talking points more clearly and go through each section one badge at a time, where as with the footnotes you may have to read through the same section several times to find your place and it makes presenting the information more difficult for those being presented to to follow along when it is a footnote as opposed to visualisation badges."
badges,6697cf02d714e7ee3fdedcec,footnotes,"Because the version with footnotes contains all the information you need, rather than having to go to the effort of finding it, or with the risk of possibly missing it, as I did with the badges in the previous task. It's just clearer to have all the information presented in one image rather than portioned out in various different places. ",footnotes,"Well, for almost exactly the same reasons as above. I find it a clearer way of presenting the information, so obviously I would find it a clearer way of presenting and explaining the information to others. Maybe the first image would be clearer if the different ""sections"" of info as indicated by the badges in image 2 were on separate lines rather than in one paragraph, but regardless the first image is clearer. ",footnotes,"I'm really not sure what extra 50 words you want me to come up with- it is the same reasoning in all cases. I find it clearer to have all the information on one page. The image with footnotes is that image, whereas the first image hides information from the viewer; I can't see that as being a preferable way to present information. ",footnotes,Same as previous 3 answers I'm afraid. 
badges,5dcfaad2dd9a740c2493fc28,badges,The text block is too long and complicated to read. The visualisations break the text down into labels in more bite size chunks and have information that is relevant to the label. I feel like it is easier to digest and therefore easier to understand. It also looks aesthetically clearer.,badges,"I think it will be easier for people to understand the visualisations as long as they could see the information that is contained within the labels themselves. I think big blocks of text like that people switch off, but if you narrow down the relevance then it is easier for people to grasp an understanding of what the text is about.",badges,"Same reasons as the last one, I just think that it is much easier to digest the information in smaller, more relevant chunks than it is with a complicated text block which isn't particularly entertaining text, just very fry and functional because it is to do with the data. They are clearly labelled with what you need.",badges,Once again it is very similar to the last question that I answered with the caveat that people can see the labels and all of the information that is contained with them. I feel the more interactive aspect is much more engaging as information rather than a chunky block of dry data regarding the specifics of the graphic. 
badges,676578e9b3ad38588f8808ba,badges,"I am not familiar with climate change and this data heavily involves in lots of terminology. It is not for everyone. On the other hand, interactive visualization is much clearly labeled and made me feel I try to understand it. The left one put me off in the first place to be honest. ",badges,"It is up to who are audiences are. If you have a presentation for more specialists in the field, the left one would be more in details. However, if you explain it to general public, right one is more easier to understand.",badges,"again, left one is visually easier to read and it showed the summary of each section when you click, so you can learn it by step by step. On the other hand, right one is just full of sentences with terminology, which puts me off as I am not familiar with the study.",badges,"If you speak to people who are the specialists, right one might be ok. But if you speak to general public, right one is too much and disorganised. Left one is easier to follow."
badges,67d088ccec81d322ccede723,footnotes,I prefer the version with footnotes because it gives me all the detailed information in one place without needing to interpret extra symbols.,footnotes,"I prefer the version wuth footnotes because when  presenting this visualization to others, it provides all necessary details in a well transparent and rigorous format  academically.",badges,Because it makes it easier for me to understand the key information.,badges,This is because it is more engaging.
badges,5d879c06e645c60019847113,badges,"The badges provide a cleaner, more organised way of processing the information shown in the footnotes.",no_preference,"While the footnote version allows one to quickly summarise the overall explanation of the visual, the badges highlight certain key aspects that you can find more quickly when presenting and explaining more specific details that may be more relevant.",badges,The visualization badges provide a cleaner more focussed caption of the visual data.,badges,"The footnotes contains a lot of information that you need to filter through in order to get to the key points which are most useful when presenting/explaining this visualisation to others, whilst the badges provide this key info more succinctly and directly."
footnotes,67f015260f679212b3c34caa,badges,I like the visualization badges because they make it easy to get answers from the graph without looking cluttered. They also don’t overwhelm the reader you can quickly find exactly what you need,footnotes,"I prefer the footnotes in the case of presentation because the information is immediately available on the screen. So there is no need to hover to see it, which makes the reading and explaining experience easier and less distracting",badges,I prefer the visualization badges sinces by just looking at it I get to know what I could possibly require to know about the graph. ,footnotes,The information is immediately available on the screen so it is easy to read to the audience and the audience can also see it with ease
footnotes,662e66138060bf4a9db8c159,badges,"The badges are organized by topic and the information is hidden from view until the reader wants more background. This makes better use of the space which is at a premium for infographics. If the footnotes were organized into four topics and hidden behind links they would be badges. This is the connection between footnotes and badges to me. Also, one of the badges is redundant. The label e.g. Actual Time Offset has information that has already been included as part of another badge e.g. Data Sources Disclosed. The badges save a lot of space. Using redundant badges works against this advantage. ",badges,"If I were presenting this material to a mixed audience, I would lead with the data. The sources of data and the science behind the estimates is essential to a deeper understanding but providing this all at once especially if it is written as a wall of text e.g. footnotes version it can be jarring to someone who hasn't seen this information before. Let's not intimidate the new people in this discussion! ",badges,The reasons I used for the first visualization carry over. This improvement of badges over footnotes is very general. I think it can be applied to almost any visualization that makes use of footnotes. Breaking down a wall of text e.g. footnotes version into several topics and hiding this information until the user needs it on demand is a great way to use the interactivity of either the www or computers in general. ,badges,"In the scenario described, I am presenting this information to a mixed audience. Some of the people may have never heard of tracking CO2 emissions over time. I would begin with the data in the graphs. Once I described each regions contribution to carbon pollution overall, I would prove this to be true. At this point, the sources and methods enter the conversation. This is where the badges would be very useful. Instead of putting together sources and methods into a wall of text in the footnotes version, I would answer questions based on what the people in the room are asking. This is a better organization tool and I could see it used in many scientific studies. It's main sticking point is that it would not translate over into a static medium e.g. paper or cardboard. For those, the author needs to go back and do things the old way e.g. either footnotes or endnotes. "
footnotes,63956692bbbcfadf1156c3a2,badges,I found the badge version a little easier to read. The footnotes did not have good contrast and were harder to read. I also like that the badges separated the footnotes into categories. I think this would be a useful feature when comparing different graphs.,no_preference,"I haven't given a presentation for a while, I used to do powerpoints on a screen and I preferred to do more talking than rereading the slides. On the one hand I think it is good the footnotes are right there on the screen. But if I was presenting in a different way where the audience had access to the badges, that would be fine with me. So for simplicity in specific circumstances I'd prefer the footnotes.",badges,"It's the same reason I gave for the first example. It's much easier for me to read the badges text than the footnotes. Also the footnotes aren't categorised, so that was useful. There is no question for me, badges are better!",no_preference,"Again my reasons for being unclear here are down to my thinking about how I would be using the visualization. I like to keep it simple, I used to have printed backups, badges would be no use there. But  in a digital world, again, maybe not always compatible ie they might not work sometimes. So I'm happy to use the badges and think they are better but they bring additional complexity when presenting or explaining."
footnotes,62d59b380be0866cf039e0ee,badges,This method feels more 'bitesize' which enables me to process information in a more targeted way rather than read a load of seeming jargon.  The colours are attractive and make me want to hover the mouse over them rather than the dull grey text you see before. ,badges,Again this is like doing a powerpoint where you present information you select or target.  Users will be more inclined to be focused on bit by bit as opposed to a really long passage of text that they may lose interest in.,footnotes,It suits my learning style better and allows me to take in the information slower and more effectively. ,footnotes,"Similar to the previous slide, in that it can feel more targeted and more streamlined rather than read full grey long jargon-like text. "
footnotes,6630ec1ebe18d48a3cecb54e,badges,I like how the badges better categorize the data so the user can look at the ones that they are interested in. It also makes the bottom of the graphic look cleaner and more presentable with just a few buttons instead of a having a big amount of text shown.  ,footnotes,"For presenting and explaining this visual, I would prefer the footnotes since all of the information is laid out for everyone to see. I feel like most people would be used to this type of display since it's more traditional for presenting this type of information.",badges,I prefer the visualization badges because they provide a cleaner and more presentable way of including the data for understanding the graph. I can also choose to only look at the badges that interest me which saves time and effort towards increasing my understanding of the data that's being presented.,footnotes,"I prefer the footnotes when presenting and explaining the data, because I feel that it's better to have all of the information laid out for everyone to see and read at their own pace. I also feel like the footnotes more clearly display the sources that have been cited for where the information was taken from, as these links can look a bit cluttered in the small amount of space within the visualization badges."
footnotes,667987c18f34110073ae20b7,badges,"The badges group the information into categorised sections, making it easier to identify important information, read and interpret it than the large block of text in the footnote on the left. It also looks much neater, because each badge only displays a few words until selected, as ooposed to a lot of small text in the footnote version.",badges,"I would definitely prefer to present the version with visualisation badges because it looks much neater. I could verbally explain relevant information, rather than having the footnote displayed along with the chart, possibly distracting my audienvce as they tried to read it at the same time as listening to my presentation.",badges,"The version with the visualisation badges is easier to understand. Instead of having all of the footnote text in one large block, it's easier to see and interpret when it's grouped into smaller sections behind each of the buttons. I find this version much easier to read and understand.",badges,"The version with the visualisation badges is much neater looking, and therefore would be my preferred version to present. Using this version, I could explain relevant information contained in the footnotes, without having a large amount of small text displayed, potentially taking focus away from the chart."
footnotes,66e4e41d14e1d19d88229740,badges,I prefer the version with visualization badges because the information is easier to scan quickly. ,footnotes,"I would prefer to use the footnotes when presenting to others because they provide complete explanations that I can refer to. When I’m explaining a complex graph, having detailed text helps me make sure I don’t misinterpret anything.",footnotes,“I prefer the version with footnotes because it provides full explanations in clear sentences. The detailed text helps me understand exactly what each element of the visualization refers to without guessing.,no_preference,"I don’t have a clear preference because each version has strengths depending on the audience. Badges are great for quick, simple presentations where people want a visual summary"
footnotes,676572d1818b3b26ca9f6ce2,footnotes,I prefer to work with the one on the left because it is written out without havin to interact with buttons. The footnote can be read together for proper understanding instead of scattered and disjointed buttons,footnotes,"If i need to present the visual i will definitely use the left because most people are used to the left one, also they may need to read the footnote while i am presenting without teling me to click buttons ",footnotes,"Talking for myself i will use the one on the right because the information is open and clear, make it easy to read through",footnotes,"Most people are used to the right one so, it is important to use what people are used to to explain tothem putting in mind that not everyone is open to change and can understand easily when they see a new approach"
