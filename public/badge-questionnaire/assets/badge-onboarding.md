## Quick reminder: badges

You recently explored the <a href="https://ukcobenefitsatlas.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Co-benefits Atlas</a>. 

On some atlas pages there were **badges**: graphical labels placed near the visualizations that provide some extra information.

Here you can see some example badges (in the read dashed border) from the atlas:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; width: 100%;">
  <img src="badge-questionnaire/assets/atlas-badge-examples.png" alt="Badge examples from the atlas" style="max-width: 900px; width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
</div>
