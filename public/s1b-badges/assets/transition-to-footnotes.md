## What happens next

You will now see the **same** visualizations again.

This time there will be **no visualization badges**, but **footnotes**.

**Footnotes** are short textual notes shown below the visualization that provide additional context and extra information (similar to the badges you saw before).

**Task:** Your task is to explore the visualization and footnotes for at least **1 minute**. We will ask you some questions in the end.
