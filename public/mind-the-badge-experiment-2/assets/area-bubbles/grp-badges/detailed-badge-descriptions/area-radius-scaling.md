# Area as Quantity (Radius Scaling)

This badge warns that **circle size is based on radius instead of area**.

In the chart, Value Y has twice the numerical value of Value X, but the radius of its circle is also doubled. Because circle **area grows with the square of the radius** \\(A = \pi r^2\\), this makes Value Y’s circle take up about **four times as much area**, even though the true difference is only **2×**.

When you see this badge:

- Remember that the **visual area** of the circle may **overstate** how different the values are.
- Focus on the **numbers and labels**, not just how big the circles look.
