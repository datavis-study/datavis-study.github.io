# Truncated Axis

This badge warns that the **vertical axis does not start at zero**.

Because the chart only shows a narrow range of values at the top of the scale, even a **small absolute difference** (here, only a few percent) can look **much larger** than it really is. This can:

- Make one bar appear dramatically taller than another.
- Lead readers to **overestimate the percentage difference** between categories.

When you see this badge, interpret the visual difference between bars **with caution** and, if possible, check the actual numbers or the full axis range.
